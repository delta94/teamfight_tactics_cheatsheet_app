## Systems

#### New Galaxies Mechanics

- Trade Sector: Players get one free reroll in each round.
- Superdense Galaxy: Upon reaching level 5, players receive a free Force of Nature.
- There's now about a 50% chance of getting a special Galaxy vs. Normal game with Trade Sector and Superdense Galaxies a tad more favored than the others.

#### Other System Stuff

> We're making it more difficult to purposely loss-streak/open-fort as it will now risk being eliminated before stage 4-7. We still think loss-streaking should still be a strategy and especially a fallback for unlucky early shop rolls or slow compositions, but they should be actively trying to lose by small margins rather than happily full-on open-forting.

- Win and Loss Streaks: 2(1g)/3(2g)/4+(3g) ⇒ 2-3(1g)/4(2g)/5+(3g)
- Base Damage per Stage: 0/3/4/5/10/15/20 ⇒ 0/0/1/2/5/10/15
- Total Damage based on the number of surviving units: 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10... ⇒ 2/4/6/8/10/11/12/13/14/15…
- Introduced new carousel variations, keep an eye out.

## Mobile Corner

- Improvements to the Friends Panel that only the eagle-eye’d of you may notice.
- Fixed a bug where some players needed to patch every time they restarted the app. That’s just silly.
- When something has gone wrong and we need you to know about it you should now see a message about it. Hopefully you never do.
- Fixed an issue where Egg Drop Tables failed their math exams and displayed the wrong numbers.
- Checkmarks now appear in Loadouts when you are viewing a Little Legend or Arena skin you already have equipped.
- We ordered the Little Legends under each species so you can find the perfect shade of Squink even quicker.
- The UFO Sprite was getting a little uppity so we removed it’s star levels in Loadouts.
- Emotes can now be placed in multiple slots. Your dreams of a full “Say that one more time.” emote wheel can now be realized.
- Sometimes your currently equipped Little Legend and Arena Skin would forget to show up on entering loadouts. We reminded them what their jobs were.
- Fixed several issues with aspect ratio & resolution resizing on some devices. Feel free to fiddle away with your screen.
- The login screen music and the home screen music were slightly out of key. We harmonized them.
- Added beautiful delicious crispy sounds to the settings menu. Not sound settings. Sounds for the settings themselves.
