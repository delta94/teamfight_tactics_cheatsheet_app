## Ranked

> This is the last patch to continue climbing the ranked ladder in Teamfight Tactics' first Season. Ranked will be off in patch 9.22 for the start of Rise of the Elements to make sure that we have any major bugs or balance issues out of the way, but it will return in patch 9.23.

## Player Damage

> Right now, player damage is both too low in the early game and too high in the late game. This leads players to take advantage of using the early game to stockpile gold, as well as really unfortunate late-game losses when trying to change up your strategy or unit placements. We're pulling level-up damage from the champions and putting it into their base damage to counteract these trends.

- 1-Star by Tier: 1/1/2/2/3 ⇒ 1/1/1/2/3
- 2-Star by Tier: 2/2/3/4/5 ⇒ 2/2/2/3/4
- 3-Star by Tier: 3/4/5/6/8 ⇒ 3/3/3/5/8
- Base Damage: 1/2/2/3/4/5 ⇒ 3/3/3/4/5/6
