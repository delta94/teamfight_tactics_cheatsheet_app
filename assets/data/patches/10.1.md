### **1/8/2020 Bugfixes**

## New Little Legends

[](https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/2020/january/pntft101/TFT_10.1_Image.jpg)

### **Flutterbug**

> Wants to take over the world -- and eat all the yummiest things in it. But, he’s very small. He often has to hide under things in order to not get squashed. While he hides, he machinates on his complex plans.

### **Craggle**

> An adorable statue carved from the finest Demacian petricite (anti-magic stone). He has a soft spot for the vulnerable creatures of the world, and tries to protect them with every ounce of his strength as if he was a giant colossus -- even if he is still growing.

### **Tocker**

> Tocker is constantly tinkering with things to make them better, even on his own body! (His left wing is always a bit squeaky). He loves meeting new people and learning about the world through his enormous blue eyes.
