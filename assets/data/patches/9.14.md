## Systems

#### Attack Speed Changes

- We've changed all champions' attack speed ratios so that attack speed bonuses are now calculated based on a percent of the champion's base attack speed. In short, champions with lower base attack speeds will receive less benefit from attack speed items. Certain champions and attack speed granting items have been adjusted in this patch to compensate.
- Champion Attack Speed Ratios: 1.0 ⇒ champion base attack speed

#### PvE Rounds

- In the event that you do not get an item during a PvE round, one of the minions, monsters, or epic monsters will now drop gold instead.
- Dragon and Elder Dragon no longer benefit from the Dragon Trait bonuses. All sorcery comps rejoice.

#### Ranked Premade Restrictions

- The ranked premade party size is now limited to three players at all ranks. Down from five below plat.

#### Level Breakpoints

- XP to 9: 70 ⇒ 64

#### Ability Targeting

- Abilities that target low health champions now determine "lowest health" by HP percentage instead of total HP

#### Shop

- When you reroll your shop after leveling up from round XP, the shop is rolled at your new level instead of your old level

#### User Interface

- Added "Streak" indicator next to gold total. It displays your current streak (win or loss) and the rewards for maintaining streaks of different lengths
- Added a combat recap so you can see how much damage each champion deals each round.
- Added champion stats (attack damage, armor, magic resist etc) on their pop up inspect panel when you right click
